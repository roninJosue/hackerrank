Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. Using the information given below, determinate
the number of apples and oranges that land on  Sam's house.

In the diagram below:
* The red region denotes the house, where **_s_** is the start point, and **_t_** is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the
left of the house, and the orange tree is to the right.
* Assume the trees ara located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point **_a_**, and the orange tree is at point **_b_**.
* When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands **_d_** units of distance from its tree of origin along **_x_**-axis. *A negative value of **_d_**
means the fruit fell **_d_** units to the tree's left, and a positive value of **_d_** means it falls **_d_** units to the tree's right.
