 Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

 Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

 * The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
 * The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday.

 Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
