Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: 
* 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
* 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

**Example**
* **s = '12:01:00PM'**

`**returns '12:01:00'**`

* **s = '12:01:00AM'**

`**returns '00:01:00'**`
