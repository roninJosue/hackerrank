An integer **_d_** is a divisor of an integer **n**** if the remainder on **_n_** / **_d_** = 0.

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the numbers of divisors
occurring within the integer.

**Example**
```
n = 124
```

Check whether **1**, **2** and **4** are divisors of **124**. All 3 numbers divide evenly into **124** so return **3**.
```
n = 111
```

Check whether **1**, **1** and **1** are divisors of **111**. All 3 numbers divide evenly into **111** so return **3**.

```
n = 10
```

Check whether **1** and **0** are divisors of **10**. **1** is but **0** is not. Return **1**.
