A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USE drive that can be purchased with a budget.
Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them.
If it is not possible to buy both items, return -1.

### Example
`b = 60`

`keyboards = [40, 50, 60]`

`drives = [5, 8, 12]`

The person can buy a **40 keyboard + 12 USB drive = 52**, or a **50 keyboard + 8 USB drive = 58**. Choose the latter as the
more expensive option and return **58**.
