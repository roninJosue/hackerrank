A discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor
decides to cancel class if fewer than some number os students are present when class starts. Arrival times go from
on time (**arrivalTime ≤ 0**) to arrived late (**arrivalTime > 0**).

Given the arrival time of each student and a threshold number of attendees, determine if the class is cancelled.

**Example**
```
n = 5
k = 3
a = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

The first **3** students arrived on. The las **2** were late. The threshold is **3** students, so class will go on. Return
YES. **Note**: Non-positive arrival times (**a[i] ≤ 0**) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive
arrival times (**a[i] > 0**) indicate the student arrived **a[i]** minutes late.
