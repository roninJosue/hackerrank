Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently 
sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

**Example**
```
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
```
There ara two each of types **1** and **2**, and one sighting of type **3**. Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type **1**.
