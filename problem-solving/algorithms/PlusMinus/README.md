Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative and zero. Print the decimal
value of each fraction on a new line with **6** places after the decimal.

**Note:** This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with
absolute error of up most **10** are acceptable.

**Example**
```
arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]
```

There are **_n_ = 5** elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are **2/5 = 0.400000**, 
**2/5 = 0.400000** and **1/5 = 0.200000**.

```
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
```
