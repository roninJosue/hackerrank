Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play.
She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game.
Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

**Example:**
```
scores = [12,24, 10, 24]
```
Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:

|Game|Score|Minimum|Maximum| Min | Max |
|---|---|---|---|----|----|
|0   |12   |12   |12   | 0  |   0 |
|1   |24   |12   |24   | 0  |   1 |
|2   |10   |10   |24   | 1  |   1 |
|3   |24   |10   |24   | 1  |   1 |

Given the scores for a season, determinate the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least
points scored during the season.
