Given a string consisting of the letters **a**, **b** and **c**, we can perform the following operation:
* Take any two adjacent distinct characters and replace them with the third character.

Find the shortest string obtainable through applying this operation repeatedly.

For example, given the string **aba** we can reduce it to **1** character string by replacing **ab** with **c** and **ca** with **b**:
```
aba -> ca -> b
```
