You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready
to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).
* The first kangaroo starts at location **_x1_** and moves at rate of **_v1_** meters per jump.
* The second  kangaroo starts at location **_x2_** and moves at a rate of **_v2_** meters per jump.

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is
possible, return `YES`, otherwise return `NO`.

**Example**
```
x1 = 2
v1 = 1
x2 = 1
v2 = 1
```

After one jump, they are both at x = 3, (x1 + v1 = 2 + 1, x2 + v2  = 1 + 2), so the answer is `YES`.
