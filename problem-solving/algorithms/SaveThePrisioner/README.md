A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. 
Their jailer decides the fairest wat to divide the treats is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs.
A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner
sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.

The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful.
Determine the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.

**Example**
```
n = 4
m = 6
s = 2
```

There are **4** prisoners, **6** pieces of candy and distribution starts at chair **2**. The prisoner arrange themselves in seats numbered
**1** to **4**. Prisoner receive candy at positions **2**, **3**, **4**, **1**, **2**, **3**. 
The prisoner to be warned sits in chair number **3**.
