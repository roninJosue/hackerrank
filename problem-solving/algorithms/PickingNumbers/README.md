Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less
than or equal **t**o 1.

**Example**

`a = [1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5]`

There are two subarrays meeting the criterion: `[1,1,2,2]` and `[4,4,5,5,5]`. The maximum length subarray has **5** elements.
