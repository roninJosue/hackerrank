We define a magic square to be an **_nxn_** matrix of distinct positive integers from **1** to **n^2** 
where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length **n** is always equal to the same number (the **magic constant**).

You will be given a 3x3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range **[1, 9]**. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range **[1, 9]**
at cost of **|a - b|**. Given **s**, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

**Note**: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range **[1, 9]**.
