Given a set of distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset of **_S_** where the sum of any 2 numbers in **_S'_** is not
evenly divisible by **_k_**.

**Example**
```
S = [19, 10, 12, 10, 24, 25, 22] k = 4
```

One of the arrays that can be created is **_S'_[0] = [10, 12, 25]**. Another is  **_S'_[1] = [19, 22, 24]**. 
After testing all permutations, the maximum length solution array has **3** elements.
