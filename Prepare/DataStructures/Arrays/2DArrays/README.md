Given a **6 x 6** 2D array, **_arr_**.
```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

An hourglass in **_A_** is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in **_arr_**'s graphical representation:
```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

There are **16** hourglass in **_arr_**. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum
for every hourglass in **arr**, the print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be **6 x 6**.

Example
```
arr = 

-9 -9 -9 1 1 1
 0 -9  0 4 3 2
-9 -9 -9 1 2 3
 0  0  8 6 6 0
 0  0  1 2 4 0
```
