You can perform the following operations on the string **_a_**:
1. Capitalize zero or more of **_a_**'s lowercase letters.
2. Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in **_a_**.

Given two strings, **_a_** and **_b_**, determinate if it's possible to make **_a_** equal to **_b_** as described.
If so, print **YES** on a new line. Otherwise, print **NO**.

For example, given **_a_** = **AbcDE** and **_b_** = **ABDE**, in **_a_** we can convert **b** and delete **c** to match **_b_**.
If **_a_** = **AbcDE** and **_b_** = **AFDE**, matching is not possible because letters may only be capitalized or discarded, not changed.
